## CSS Triangle with Hover Effect

This is a nice example of hovering and clip-path example I practiced a while ago taken from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6x-VrY2nJ4).

This is pure HTML and CSS ONLY!!

I hope you like it, code it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/otCSSTriangleWithHoverEffect/) !
